## 🌟 Goals of the Repository

* 📅 Solve **1 problem daily** to maintain consistency
* 🧩 Focus on **problem patterns** rather than memorizing solutions
* 🚀 Prepare for **top technical interviews** (FAANG, service/product-based companies)
* 📘 Build a **strong foundation in Data Structures & Algorithms**
* 💬 Encourage others to discuss, optimize, and learn together

---

## 🔍 Additional Highlights

* Every solution includes **time and space complexity analysis**
* Contains **multiple approaches** (Brute Force → Optimized)
* Helpful **comments and explanations** for key logic steps
* Includes **LeetCode problem links** for easy navigation

---

## 🧩 Future Scope

* Add **topic-wise README summaries**
* Integrate **difficulty-level badges** (Easy / Medium / Hard)
* Maintain **leaderboard of solved problems per month**
* Implement **auto-solution tester script** for C++ submissions
